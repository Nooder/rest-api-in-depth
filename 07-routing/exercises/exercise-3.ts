/*
    1. Start a new Deno workspace and create a
       server.ts file

    2. Create a web server in Deno and listen
       on the default port (8000)

    3. Create a home.html file that has at least
       and <img> tag in it with it's "src" pointing
       to an image of your choosing. Put the html file
       and image in the same folder as your server.js.

    4. Respond to any requests to your server with the
       home.html file but make it so the <img> tag is
       able to successfully download the image file from
       your server too.

    5. Test this in both your Browser and Insomnia to see
       if it works.

    *HINT1 You should be able to see the home webpage with
           it's image showing up correctly. Check the network
           tab in Chrome to see the requests/responses.
    *HINT2 How can you conditionally route the image request?
