    1. Start a new Deno workspace and create a
       server.ts file

    2. Create a web server in Deno and listen
       on the default port (8000)

    3. Use the URLPattern API to match the following
       routes and respond accordingly:
       - http://localhost:8000/register -> "Registered!"
       - http://localhost:8000/login -> "Logged in!"
       - http://localhost:8000/logout -> "Logged out!"
       - Every other route -> "Not Found"

    4. Test these routes in both your Browser and
       Insomnia to see if they work.
