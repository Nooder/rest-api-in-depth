/*
    1. Create a new Deno project/workspace

    2. Read in the movies.json file as a string and
       parse it in to a Javascript Object (JSON.parse)

    3. Use the URLPattern API to create a route for:
       /movies

    4. Respond to any GET request to the /movies route
       with all the movies in the file as a JSON string,
       but any other method (POST, PUT etc) or route
       should return a 404 status code

    5. Test this in Insomnia and change the request
       method type to check if the /movies route works
       as well as any of the 404 routes
