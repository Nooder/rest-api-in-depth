    1. How would you design the routes and query
       parameters to allow the following:

       - Search all movies by multiple genres
       - Search all movies by title/keywords
       - Search all movies by BOTH title/words
         AND genre (double filter)

    2. What other filtering URL schemes can you
       think of/design?
