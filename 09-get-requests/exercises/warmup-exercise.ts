/*
    1. Create a new Deno project/workspace

    2. Respond to any GET request with 200 status code
       (regardless of route), but any other method
       (POST, PUT etc) should return a  404 status code

    3. Test this in Insomnia and change the request
       method type to check for the 404s and 200s

    *HINT How can you check for the Request Object's
          method type? You can check the MDN Docs too
