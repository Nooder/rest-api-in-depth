/*
    1. Create a new Deno project/workspace

    2. Respond to any POST request with 201 status code
       (regardless of route), but any other method
       (GET, PUT etc) should return a  404 status code

    3. Add a JSON body to your POST request in Insomnia
       and log out the contents of the body in the console

    4. Test this in Insomnia and change the request
       method type to check for the 404s and 201s. Also,
       check to make sure the body is logged out too
